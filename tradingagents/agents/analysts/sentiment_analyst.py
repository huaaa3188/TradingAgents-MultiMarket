"""Sentiment analyst — multi-source sentiment analysis for a target ticker.

Previously named ``social_media_analyst``. Renamed and redesigned because
the old version had a prompt that demanded social-media analysis but the
only tool available was Yahoo Finance news — which led LLMs to fabricate
Reddit/X/StockTwits content under prompt pressure (verified live).

The redesigned agent pre-fetches three complementary data sources before
the LLM is invoked and injects them into the prompt as structured blocks:

  1. News headlines     — Yahoo Finance (institutional framing)
  2. StockTwits messages — retail-trader posts indexed by cashtag, with
                           user-labeled Bullish/Bearish sentiment tags
  3. Reddit posts        — r/wallstreetbets, r/stocks, r/investing

The agent does not use tool-calling; the data is in the prompt from
turn 0. Output uses the structured-output pattern (json_schema for
OpenAI/xAI, response_schema for Gemini, tool-use for Anthropic), falling
back to free-text generation for providers that lack native support, so
the sentiment header (band + score + confidence) is deterministic across
runs and providers instead of free-form per-model prose.

3. **Weight Reddit posts by engagement.** A 400-upvote / 200-comment thread reflects community attention; a 3-upvote post is noise. Read the body excerpts for context — the title alone often misleads.
4. **Distinguish opinion from event.** A news headline ("Nvidia announces $500M Corning deal") is an event; a StockTwits post ("buying NVDA, this is going to moon") is opinion. Both are inputs but should be weighted differently in your conclusions.
